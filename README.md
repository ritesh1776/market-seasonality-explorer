## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Framework:** React (with Vite)
- **UI Components:** Material-UI (`@mui/material`, `@mui/icons-material`, `@mui/x-date-pickers`)
- **Charting:** Recharts
- **Data Fetching:** Axios
- **Date Manipulation:** date-fns

## üìù Assumptions Made

- **Data Source:** All financial data is sourced from the public, free-to-use Binance API endpoints.
- **Instrument:** The application is hardcoded to analyze the `BTC/USDT` pair for demonstration purposes.
- **Live Data:** The "live" data in the "Today's Market" panel is simulated by polling the API every 15 seconds.
- **Volatility:** Volatility is calculated as a simple daily price range `(High - Low) / Open` for the calendar heatmap.
- **Data Granularity:** The yearly/monthly charts use daily data, while weekly/daily charts use hourly/15-minute data where appropriate to provide detailed views.

## ‚úÖ Testing

This project uses **Vitest** for unit testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of core data processing and utility functions.

### What is Tested?

The tests are focused on the pure functions located in the `src/utils/` directory. This ensures that key logic is correct, reliable, and protected from future regressions.

- **Financial Calculations (`indicators.js`)**:

  - `calculateSMA`: Verifies that the Simple Moving Average is calculated correctly.
  - `calculateRSI`: Verifies that the Relative Strength Index is calculated correctly.

- **Date Logic (`dateHelpers.js`)**:
  - These tests use **date mocking** to run against a fixed "today" date, ensuring consistent and predictable results.
  - Verifies the correct generation of lists for weeks, months, and years.

### How to Run Tests

To run the full suite of unit tests, execute the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
npm test
```
